- Caught a new fish? Get a notification.
- Open a UI via key bind to see all of the unique fish, which ones you've caught, and the ones you need.
- Quick stats.

### Either future features or scope creep their way into V1
- Share option
  - Lets you 'export' your dex as a string to share with people.
  - Lets you 'import' a shared string to see which fish the other person has caught.
  - Lets you see the differences between your dex and the shared dex.
